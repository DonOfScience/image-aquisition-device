# image-aquisition-device
This is a repository for my image acquisition device project. The device includes an RGBLED button, toggle switch, two stepper motors, strobe light indicator, piezo buzzer, pi camera module 2, HMI touch screen, and FLIR camera. These devices work together on the Raspberry pi 4B to capture highly calibrated images of slide specimens.
